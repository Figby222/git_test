Hello world, my name is Ryan Posey! I am a rising student of The Odin Project,
and I'm looking forward to learning more whilst studying the information provided
in the curriculum. 

My main goals are to become proficcient in web development, as well as to 
excell in the development of mobile applications.

I have a couple of strengths that may help me to reach my goals, one of which
is my capability to learn information quickly, as well as my ability to think
of ideas for applications, games, gadgets, etc. nearly on the spot! 

However, no one is perfect, and there are certainly areas in which 
I could build upon to further enhance my skillset.

My biggest hobbies right now are playing video games, playing awesome 
tunes on the piano, and, of course, I dabble in a bit of programming!
